Summary:

Written in C++, this project is a simple spaceship game where you fly through space and shoot down meteors. The overall goal of this project is to create the foundation of a library I can reuse in the future for more complicated video games. With this current project, the library will have the basic capabilities to render images onto the screen, read in user input, play sounds/music and simulate a basic physics system. 

The project uses Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL). SDL isn't a game engine, but rather is a library that only provides "low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D" (https://www.libsdl.org/). The actual game engine is the code on this repo.  

While it is definitely more quicker and efficient to use an already established game engine like Unity and Unreal, I feel like this is a better way to practice and improve my programming and software engineering skills.
